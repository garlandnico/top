						In the grim dark of the far future, the mighty legacy of the Vikings lives on with the Space Wolves. One of three founding chapters originally distrusted by the first Space Marine Legions, the Wolves have distinguished themselves with a history of courage and unmatched bravery and ferocity in combat. This is good, because they also have a history of anti-authoritarian ways and are one of the most extremely Codex Astartes deviant chapters. While they are not quite as concerned with human life as another particular Chapter, they do not blindly follow the decries of the Inquisition and question their methods consistently.
