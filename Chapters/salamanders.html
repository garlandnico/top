						The fire-born sons of Vulkan, the Salamanders love to engage in mid-to-close ranged combat with powerful flame and heat based weapons like melta guns, flamers, and the rare combi-bolters. Every Salamander is a trained artificer, and have some of the best armor, weapons, and wargear in the 41st millennium.The Salamanders believe that the primary duty the Emperor bred them for was the protection of human life of the Imperium. Because of this the Salamanders care more for human life and maintain a closer relationship with the humans of their home world, Nocturne, than any other Chapter. Salamanders retain the full memories of their previous lives before ascending to Space Marines, and some even maintain relationships with their previous families. Always viewed warily by other Chapters to to their ember-red eyes and coal-black skin, considered by some Chapters as 'mutant', the Salamanders earn respect throughout the Imperium by a willingness to charge into battles and give their lives purely to protect the people of the Imperium. While not quite as anti-authoritarian as their Space Wolf cousins, the Salamanders do question the Inquisition and their methods since the Inquisition tends to view individual human life as disposable as long as it keeps the Imperium running. There are strong hints that the Salamanders would break away from the Imperium, but that without the Imperium, no matter how corrupt, Mankind as a whole would fall to Chaos and alien threats. Their unique outlook on human life and their duties as soldiers, combined with their courage, ferocity, and skill in battle, make the Salamanders the most interesting and best of the Space Marine Chapters.
